        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Language Analysis contains three components: Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, and Semantic Analysis. Semantic Role Labelling (SRL) is one way for Shallow Semantic Analysis. A predicate of a sentence is a property that a subject possesses or is characterized, such as what it does, what it is or how it is, which mostly corresponds to the core of an event. The noun associated with a predicate is called Argument. Semantic roles express the abstract roles that arguments of a predicate can take in the event, such as Agent, Patient, Theme, Experiencer, Beneficiary, Instrument, Location, Goal and Source, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following example, “遇到” (encounters) is a Predicate (“Pred”)，“小明” (Ming) is an Agent，“小红” (Hong) is a Patient，“昨天” (yesterday) indicates the Time, and “公园” (park) is the Location.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mbox{[小明]}_{\\mbox{Agent}}\\mbox{[昨天]}_{\\mbox{Time}}\\mbox{[晚上]}_\\mbox{Time}\\mbox{在[公园]}_{\\mbox{Location}}\\mbox{[遇到]}_{\\mbox{Predicate}}\\mbox{了[小红]}_{\\mbox{Patient}}\\mbox{。}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of in-depth analysis on semantic information, the goal of Semantic Role Labeling is to identify the relation of predicate and other constituents, e.g., predicate-argument structure, as specific semantic roles, which is an important intermediate step in a wide range of natural language understanding tasks (Information Extraction, Discourse Analysis, DeepQA etc). Predicates are always assumed to be given; the only thing is to identify arguments and their semantic roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard SRL system mostly builds on top of Syntactic Analysis and contains five steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Construct a syntactic parse tree, as shown in Fig. 1\n",
        "2. Identity candidate arguments of given predicate from constructed syntactic parse tree.\n",
        "3. Prune most unlikely candidate arguments.\n",
        "4. Identify arguments, often by a binary classifier.\n",
        "5. Multi-class semantic role labeling. Steps 2-3 usually introduce hand-designed features based on Syntactic Analysis (step 1).\n",

        "\n",
        "However, complete syntactic analysis requires identifying the relation among all constitutes and the performance of SRL is sensitive to the precision of syntactic analysis, which makes SRL a very challenging task. To reduce the complexity and obtain some syntactic structure information, we often use shallow syntactic analysis. Shallow Syntactic Analysis is also called partial parsing or chunking. Unlike complete syntactic analysis which requires the construction of the complete parsing tree, Shallow Syntactic Analysis only need to identify some independent components with relatively simple structure, such as verb phrases (chunk). To avoid difficulties in constructing a syntactic tree with high accuracy, some work\\[[1](#Reference)\\] proposed semantic chunking based SRL methods, which convert SRL as a sequence tagging problem. Sequence tagging tasks classify syntactic chunks using BIO representation. For syntactic chunks forming a chunk of type A, the first chunk receives the B-A tag (Begin), the remaining ones receive the tag I-A (Inside), and all chunks outside receive the tag O-A.\n",

        "\u003c/div\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "This example illustrates the simplicity of sequence tagging because (1) shallow syntactic analysis reduces the precision requirement of syntactic analysis; (2) pruning candidate arguments is removed; 3) argument identification and tagging are finished at the same time. Such unified methods simplify the procedure, reduce the risk of accumulating errors and boost the performance further.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, our SRL system is built as an end-to-end system via a neural network. We take only text sequences, without using any syntactic parsing results or complex hand-designed features. We give public dataset [CoNLL-2004 and CoNLL-2005 Shared Tasks](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~srlconll/) as an example to illustrate: given a sentence with predicates marked, identify the corresponding arguments and their semantic roles by sequence tagging method.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks are important tools for sequence modeling and have been successfully used in some natural language processing tasks. Unlike Feed-forward neural networks, RNNs can model the dependency between elements of sequences. LSTMs as variants of RNNs aim to model long-term dependency in long sequences. We have introduced this in [understand_sentiment](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/understand_sentiment). In this chapter, we continue to use LSTMs to solve SRL problems.\n",

        "### Stacked Recurrent Neural Network\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep Neural Networks allows extracting hierarchical representations. Higher layers can form more abstract/complex representations on top of lower layers. LSTMs, when unfolded in time, is a deep feed-forward neural network, because a computational path between the input at time $k \u003c t$ to the output at time $t$ crosses several nonlinear layers. However, the computation carried out at each time-step is only linear transformation, which makes LSTMs a shallow model. Deep LSTMs are typically constructed by stacking multiple LSTM layers on top of each other and taking the output from lower LSTM layer at time $t$ as the input of upper LSTM layer at time $t$. Deep, hierarchical neural networks can be much efficient at representing some functions and modeling varying-length dependencies\\[[2](#Reference)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, deep LSTMs increases the number of nonlinear steps the gradient has to traverse when propagated back in depth. For example, four layer LSTMs can be trained properly, but the performance becomes worse as the number of layers up to 4-8. Conventional LSTMs prevent backpropagated errors from vanishing and exploding by introducing shortcut connections to skip the intermediate nonlinear layers. Therefore, deep LSTMs can consider shortcut connections in depth as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The operation of a single LSTM cell contain 3 parts: (1) input-to-hidden: map input $x$ to the input of the forget gates, input gates, memory cells and output gates by linear transformation (i.e., matrix mapping); (2) hidden-to-hidden: calculate forget gates, input gates, output gates and update memory cell, this is the main part of LSTMs; (3)hidden-to-output: this part typically involves an activation operation on hidden states. Based on the stacked LSTMs, we add a shortcut connection: take the input-to-hidden from the previous layer as a new input and learn another linear transformation.\n",

        "\n",
        "LSTMs can summarize the history of previous inputs seen up to now, but can not see the future. In most of NLP (natural language processing) tasks, the entire sentences are ready to use. Therefore, sequential learning might be much efficient if the future can be encoded as well like histories.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address the above drawbacks, we can design bidirectional recurrent neural networks by making a minor modification. Higher LSTM layers process the sequence in reversed direction with previous lower LSTM layers, i.e., Deep LSTMs operate from left-to-right, right-to-left, left-to-right,..., in depth. Therefore, LSTM layers at time-step $t$ can see both histories and the future since the second layer. Fig. 4 illustrates the bidirectional recurrent neural networks.\n",

In SRL tasks, CRF is built on top of the network for the final tag sequence prediction. It takes the representations provided by the last LSTM layer as input.\n",

        "CRF is a probabilistic graph model (undirected) with nodes denoting random variables and edges denoting dependencies between nodes. To be simplicity, CRFs learn conditional probability $P(Y|X)$, where $X = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)$ are sequences of input, $Y = (y_1, y_2, ... , y_n)$ are label sequences; Decoding is to search sequence $Y$ to maximize conditional probability $P(Y|X)$, i.e., $Y^* = \\mbox{arg max}_{Y} P(Y | X)$。\n",

        "\n",
        "Semantic Role Labeling is an important intermediate step in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. In this tutorial, we give SRL as an example to introduce how to use PaddlePaddle to do sequence tagging tasks. Proposed models are from our published paper\\[[10](#Reference)\\]. We only use test data as an illustration since train data on CoNLL 2005 dataset is not completely public. We hope to propose an end-to-end neural network model with fewer dependencies on natural language processing tools but is comparable, or even better than traditional models. Please check out our paper for more information and discussions.\n",
